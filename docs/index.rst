Neo4j.rb (the `neo4j <https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j>`_ and `neo4j-core <https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j-core>`_ gems) is a `Ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>`_ Object-Graph-Mapper (OGM) for the `Neo4j <http://neo4j.com/>`_ graph database. It tries to follow API conventions established by `ActiveRecord <http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html>`_ and familiar to most Ruby developers but with a Neo4j flavor.

Ruby
  (software) A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

Graph Database
  (computer science) A graph database stores data in a graph, the most generic of data structures, capable of elegantly representing any kind of data in a highly accessible way.

Neo4j
  (databases) The world's leading graph database


If you're already familiar with ActiveRecord, DataMapper, or Mongoid, you'll find the Object Model features you've come to expect from an O*M:

 * Properties
 * Indexes / Constraints
 * Callbacks
 * Validation
 * Assocations
Because relationships are first-class citizens in Neo4j, models can be created for both nodes and relationships.

Additional features include
---------------------------

 * A chainable `arel <https://github.com/rails/arel>`_-inspired query builder
 * Transactions
 * Migration framework

Requirements
------------

 * Ruby 1.9.3+ (tested in MRI and JRuby)
 * Neo4j 2.1.0 + (version 4.0+ of the gem is required to use neo4j 2.2+)
